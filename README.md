### Hi there 👋

This is Jose, a lifelong learner. Currently, I am a data scientist at the Colombian start-up Globalwork, where I have support tasks related to data engineering using services like AWS Glue and Apache Spark framework and data analysis on the BI platform Metabase. Although my formal education is in Chemical Engineering (currently pursuing my PhD), I love technology and I consider myself a tech enthusiast.
