# Hi there 👋

This is Jose, a lifelong learner from Colombia 🇨🇴. Currently, I am a data scientist at the Colombian start-up [@Globalwork](https://globalwork.co/) 🧑🏻‍💻, where I have support tasks related to data engineering using services like AWS Glue and Apache Spark framework ⚙️🛢️ and data analysis on the BI platform Metabase 📊🔍. Although my formal education is in Chemical Engineering 🧪(currently pursuing my PhD 🎓), I love technology and I consider myself a tech enthusiast.
